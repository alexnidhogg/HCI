## Possible Added Features

* Having areas on a map be lit up different colors based on how many confrimed cases of covid there are in the area.
* Possibly have a route planning service for people to avoid places with high covid counts.
* Link up to friends and family in order to let them know to quarantine if someone they interacted with is confirmed to have contracted covid.
* If the app displays statistics, it should get them from a third party api the way google does instead of maintaining their own numbers manually. That would make it much easier to manage.
* Linking to existing health services instead of relying on volunteer help would help ensure that people at risk get the proper treatment.
